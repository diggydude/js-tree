# js-tree
A simple data tree structure with search and graphing functions.

This is a JavaScript version of the PHP script found here:

https://github.com/diggydude/php-tree

This is not a BTree or B+ Tree or any other kind of high-performance n-ary tree. It has more in common with the HTML Document Object Model (DOM).

There are no iterators. Instead, the Tree and Node classes have methods useful for graphing search results and various types of subtrees.

While this isn't a "TreeView" script per se, you can style it to work with some TreeView scripts.

See examples.html and the comments in the PHP version of the code for more details.
